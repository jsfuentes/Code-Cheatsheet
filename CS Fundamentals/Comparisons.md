## Monorepo vs Manyrepo

Mono is better for atomic changes and is the more popular choice

Many seperates the pull requests and commit history of mostly seperate projects

## Yarn vs NPM

NPM:

- New version of npm has lock-packages
- Included with node
- Doesn't go through Facebook's mirror(privacy???)

Yarn:

- Use deterministic installation, better caches/faster
- Uses package.json, so super super easy to switch; can use both at once
- Emojis

### Vi vs emacs

Emacs 

- common shortcuts on terminal, google docs, Typora, etc 
- more powerful editor 

Vi

- more ergonamic shortcuts and easier navigation cuz modes
- stronger for masters
- Faster/more commonly on machines
- commands not beautiful, more acronyms
