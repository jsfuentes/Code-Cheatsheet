# Reddit API

Python => Praw(Python Reddit API Wrapper)

1) https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps - And add an app to get secret

2) Send the user to the auth url: 

```
https://www.reddit.com/api/v1/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&response_type=TYPE&
state=RANDOM_STRING&redirect_uri=URI&duration=DURATION&scope=SCOPE_STRING
```

3) If authed, the user redirected to redirect_uri with code and state in query string

4) Post to the `https://www.reddit.com/api/v1/access_token`  with `grant_type=authorization_code&code=CODE&redirect_uri=URI`

....

## Dealing With Stuff

### Determine Available Attributes of an Object

If you have a PRAW object, e.g., [`Comment`](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/models/comment.html#praw.models.Comment), [`Message`](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/models/message.html#praw.models.Message), [`Redditor`](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/models/redditor.html#praw.models.Redditor), or [`Submission`](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/models/submission.html#praw.models.Submission), and you want to see what attributes are available along with their values, use the built-in [`vars()`](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/functions.html#vars) function of python. For example:

```
import pprint

# assume you have a Reddit instance bound to variable `reddit`
submission = reddit.submission(id='39zje0')
print(submission.title) # to make it non-lazy
pprint.pprint(vars(submission))
```

Note the line where we print the title. PRAW uses lazy objects so that network requests to Redditâ€™s API are only issued when information is needed. Here, before the print line, `submission` points to a lazy [`Submission`](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/models/submission.html#praw.models.Submission) object. When we try to print its title, additional information is needed, thus a network request is made, and the instances ceases to be lazy. Outputting all the attributes of a lazy object will result in fewer attributes than expected.
