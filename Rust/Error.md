# Error

The `?` operator at the end of a Rust function is known as the "try operator" or "question mark operator." It's a powerful feature introduced in Rust 1.38 that simplifies error handling in functions. Let's dive into its usage and benefits.

### Understanding the `?` Operator

The `?` operator is used to propagate errors up the call stack automatically. When used at the end of a function, it unwraps the result of the last expression in the function and returns early if there's an error.

### How It Works

1. If the last expression evaluates to `Ok(value)`, the function continues executing normally.
2. If the last expression evaluates to `Err(error)`, the function immediately returns with that error.
3. The `?` operator only works on types that implement the `Try` trait, such as `Result` and `Option`.
