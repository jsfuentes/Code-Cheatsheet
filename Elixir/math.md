# Math

All ops normal, except `/` always returns float

div(5, 4) is integer division => 1

rem(5, 4) is modulo => 1

Float, Integer different and different libs 

Kernel has functions that work on many

```elixir
easiness_factor = (card.easiness_factor + (0.1 - (5 - q) * (0.08 + (5 - q) * 0.02))) |> Float.round(3) |> Kernel
```
