# Tech to Try

### My Preferred Tech Stack

For static sites, Next.js/Typescript/Tailwindcss with serverless functions deployed on https://vercel.com

For complex/dynamic sites, React/Redux/Typescript/Tailwindcss frontend with Phoenix/Elixir backend and Postgres DB deployed on https://render.com 

Domains from Namecheap and Cloudflare CDN/Nameserver

## To Better Current Stack

1. React Transitions from v18
2. Figure out benefits/when to use Webassembly
3. useSSR / react query library
4. Deploy some Elixir Clusters
5. Try render.com yaml deployment
6. When you send elixir message that doesnt have handler, it throws timeout error

## New Techs to Try

1. Rust
2. Google App Engine for Deployment
3. Redis
4. ELK(elasticsearch, logstash, kibana)
5. RPC 
6. Kubernetes
7. GraphQL - https://www.apollographql.com/blog/zero-config-graphql-state-management-27b1f1b3c2c3

### ### Other Notable Stuff

1. [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/), a terminal for devs
   1. Like code editor with selction, dropdown of code suggestions, AI command search
   2. Share/save workflows and commands, could be good for team onboarding but prob not worth whatever price
2. Remix Library - New Full Stack Framework that instead of loading components in cascading manner with their API calls, load in parallel https://remix.run/
3. [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/) for structured note taking - big problem is it doesn't autopreview markdown so takes up so much space
