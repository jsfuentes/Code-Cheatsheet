# Matlab/Octave

Each file is a function, check console to see output and run functions

IN other files simply call the function name

You need to add folders to the load path in octave, type `path` into console to see the current files

Arrays index from 1

```matlab
S[:] #pretty sure this turns matrix into vector
S' #transpose matrix
```

### Octave

In console, install pkgs with:

```matlab
pkg install --forge [package-name]
```
