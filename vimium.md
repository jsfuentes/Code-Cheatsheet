# Vimium

Chrome plugin that lets you navigate the browser with your keyboard!

**? is help**	

**f is link follow**

- **j/k:** Scroll down/up
- **h/l:** Scroll right/left
- **gg (in succession):** Jump back to the top of a page
- **G (note the capital):** Jump to the bottom of a page
- **d/u:** Scroll a half page down/up

And you have a few other utilities that work as well. You might not have use for all of these, or prefer your browser's built-in shortcuts, but I find them quite handy, and easier to fit into a reading/searching flow. Especially "yy" for quickly copying a page URL:

- **J/K:** Switch tabs left/right

- **/:** Enter "find" mode (type in search terms to instantly jump to them)

- **n/N:** Jump forward/back between occurrences of search term (after pressing "/")

- **yy:** Copy the current page's URL to your clipboard.

  Use **esc** to exit a text box or not follow a link after f
