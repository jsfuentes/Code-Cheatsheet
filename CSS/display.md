## HTML 5

All elements inline by default

Div is full width and needed height

Tables have equal heights

### Box-sizing

**Content-box** | border-box

- Does the width you declare about the content or the content with padding? 

- So does padding add to width or within width. Border-box would say within, default is content-box
