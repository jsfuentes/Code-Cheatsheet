# Position

There are five different position values:

- `static`(default)

## Moving

If not static, elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties

- `relative` - adjusted away from normal pos
- `fixed` - positioned relative to the viewport, doesnt scroll
- `absolute` -realtive to the nearest positioned ancestor or viewport if none
- `sticky` - relative until it would be out of viewport then fixed
