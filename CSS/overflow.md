# Overflow

Control what happens when content too big either scroll/clip

- `visible` - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box
- `hidden` - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
- `scroll` - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
- `auto` - Similar to `scroll`, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary
