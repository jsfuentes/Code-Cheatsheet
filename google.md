# Google Advanced 

[some cool uses](https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/)

### “search term”

Force an exact‐match search. Use this to refine results for ambiguous searches, or to exclude synonyms when searching for single words.

**Example:** **“steve jobs”**

### OR

Search for X *or* Y. This will return results related to X or Y, or both. **Note:** The pipe (|) operator can also be used in place of “OR.”

**Examples:** **jobs OR gates** / **jobs | gates**

### AND

Search for X *and* Y. This will return only results related to both X *and* Y. **Note:** It doesn’t really make much difference for regular searches, as Google defaults to “AND” anyway. But it’s very useful when paired with other operators.

**Example**: **jobs AND gates**

### -

Exclude a term or phrase. In our example, any pages returned will be related to jobs but *not* Apple (the company).

**Example:** **jobs -apple**

### site:

Limit results to those from a specific website.

**Example:** **site:apple.com**

### related:

Find sites related to a given domain.

**Example:** **related:apple.com**
