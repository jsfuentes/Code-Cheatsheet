# Cli

```bash
gatsby new gatsby-site
```

### Start development server

```bash
gatsby develop
```

Gatsby will start a hot-reloading development environment accessible by default at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Create a production build

```shell
gatsby build
```

Gatsby will perform an optimized production build for your site, generating static HTML and per-route JavaScript code bundles.

### Serve the production build locally

```shell
gatsby serve
```

Gatsby starts a local HTML server for testing your built site. Remember to build your site using `gatsby build` before using this command.
