# General Debugging

## Project Planning

What is the core problem you are solving? What are the MVP features to solve that?

## Function/Algorithm Planning

1) Write down Input and Output
2) Theorize all edge cases
3) Think of simplest way to do it
4) Think of all the possible ways to do it
5) Mentally test and calculate Big-O to choose alg
6) Pseudocode
7) Write Code
8) Manually/Progamatically test on all your edge cases

## My common errors

- Getting the opposite boolean expression from what I want
- Type errors in untyped langauges
- Don't actually think about what to do upon errors
