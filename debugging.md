# General Debugging

## Project Planning

Are you sure the project will work? Is there a better way to do it?  

1) Input and Output

2) Theorize edge cases

3) Pseudocode

4) Mentally test

5) Explore technologies so you can be sure of interactions

6) Actually write code and adapt

## My common errors

- Getting the opposite boolean expression from what I want
- Type errors in untyped langauges
- Don't actually think about what to do upon errors
