# General Debugging

## Project Planning

What is the core problem you are solving? What are the MVP features to solve that?

## Function/Algorithm Planning

1) Write down Input and Output
2) Theorize all edge cases
3) Think of simplest way to do it
4) Think of all the possible ways to do it
5) Mentally test and calculate Big-O to choose alg
6) Pseudocode
7) Write Code
8) Manually/Progamatically test on all your edge cases

## My common errors

- Getting the opposite boolean expression from what I want
- Type errors in untyped langauges
- Don't actually think about what to do upon errors

## Debugging Tips

- Remove complexity until it start working then slowly add thing back
- Change some variables/factors and see if it still breaks, local vs prod or extremely simple cases
- For package issues, if a google search/standard debugging doesn't help, check how new your release is and the github repo for issues. Consider changing versions
