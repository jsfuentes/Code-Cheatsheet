# Webhook

Instead of pulling the data like an API, a webhook is when the provider pushes the data to you by sending a post request.

Good for:

- When events can happen at anytime, like payment authorization takes days

Authentication

- Stripe signs requests
- Pass secrets or tokens like GitHub
-
