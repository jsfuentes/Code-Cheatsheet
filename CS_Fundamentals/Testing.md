# Testing

Diminishing returns for code coverage given time

Good Tests: 

- run fast
- doesn't break often
- easy to understand
- catches bugs
- good coverage to effort ratio'

### Test Strategy

Need Iteration to find good test strategy

Mocking too much reduces test quality

Good ideas:

- Writing test setup utilities functions
- Categorize types of tests and make templates
