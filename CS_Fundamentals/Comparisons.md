## Monorepo vs Manyrepo

Mono is better for atomic changes and is the more popular choice

Many seperates the pull requests and commit history of mostly seperate projects

## Yarn vs NPM

NPM:

- New version of npm has lock-packages
- Included with node
- Doesn't go through Facebook's mirror(privacy???)

Yarn:

- Use deterministic installation, better caches/faster
- Uses package.json, so super super easy to switch; can use both at once
- Emojis
