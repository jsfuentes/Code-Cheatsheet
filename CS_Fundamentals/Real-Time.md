# Real-Time

How do you do stuff like realtime updates, push changes from server to clients?

## Websockets

[Sockets.io](https://socket.io/)

Create a sustained connection that both sides listen to, remove work of constantly doing a handshake and creating a connection

## Kafka

Heavy duty producer consumer relationship

All these producers publish to kafka to their own or a common stream, and all these consumers can subscribe to the data streams
