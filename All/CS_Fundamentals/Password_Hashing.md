# Password Hashing

Recommendation: Argon2, won 2014-2016 password hashing contest

1. **Argon2**: Likely to see increased adoption as the new standard for password hashing. Its flexibility and security make it well-positioned for future cryptographic needs.
2. **bcrypt**: Will continue to be widely used due to its established presence and simplicity. However, it may gradually be replaced by Argon2 in high-security applications.
3. **scrypt**: Will remain relevant, especially in cryptocurrency and other memory-hard applications. However, it may lose ground to Argon2 in general use cases.
4. **PBKDF2**: Due to its widespread implementation and FIPS compliance, PBKDF2 will continue to be used, but it's likely to be phased out in favor of more secure alternatives for password hashing.
