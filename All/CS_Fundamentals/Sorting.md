# Sorting

- Quick Sort: O(nlogn) in practice but O(nÂ²) worst-case, sort around pivot
- Merge Sort, Heap Sort: Consistent O(n log n)
- Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort: Simple O(n^2)
- Counting Sort, Radix Sort**: Non-comparison sorts, efficient for specific use cases.**
- Tim Sort: Highly optimized for real-world data and widely used in standard libraries including JS and Python, basically combined Merge Sort and Insertion Sort
