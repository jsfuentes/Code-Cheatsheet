# Jupyter Notebook

### Setup

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

### Usage

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

#### Magic Functions

`%matplotlib inline` [sets the backend of matplotlib to the 'inline' backend](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/plotting.html):

> With this backend, the output of plotting commands is displayed inline within frontends like the Jupyter notebook, directly below the code cell that produced it. The resulting plots will then also be stored in the notebook document.

## Multiple Kernels/Environments

In the environment, run `pip install ipykernel`
