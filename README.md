# Code Cheatsheets

My personal coding notes/snippets that I always have open when I'm coding to add to or search. It is meant to be terse and for application and thus requires good background knowledge. I started this in the beginning of 2018 and so all my knowledge from before then(CS classes) are absent.

### My Guidelines

- Purpose is not to learn concepts, but to remember syntax and usage
- This isn't not meant to be everything or very advanced/complex usage, just things used often
- The more often used ideas should be near the top of docs
- Accuracy of information is super essential, but incomplete information/ideas/questions/sentences will be put down
  - Put a `*` on the section or piece if the code/idea is AI generated and unconfirmed


## Structure

- `All` folders will have the notes and languages, but the main level should be for my favorite languages because I use it soooo often and it can get annoying to navigate otherwise. It does mean some stuff can be in two places, but easier to use
- Each folder can have
  - README.md for the most general/basic concepts and examples/syntax
  - setup.md to describe how to install and get boilerplate working
  - packages folders for nonstandard packages, but general/standard packages often used can be left in the main folder
- If two folder concepts overlap, then it will be where it seems most useful/what folder you will already be in when you need it (still pretty vague)
  - e.g Docker in AWS will be in AWS folder not the Docker folder
  - e.g Python AWS SDK will be in the Python folder not the AWS folder

## Usage

- My current favorite tool to access is [Typora](https://typora.io/) b/c lightweight, instant/inline markdown visualization, and quick open shortcut
