# Code Cheatsheets

These are my notes for me that I use while I program and add to as I learn new things. It is meant to be terse and thus require good background knowledge and be for application. I started this in the beginning of  2018 and so all my knowledge from before then(CS classes) are absent.

### My Guidelines

- Purpose is not to learn concepts, but to remember syntax and usage
- README's in each folder give basics or needed background for entire folder
- packages folders will have packages used for specific purposes, general/standard packages often used can be left in the main folder 
- This isn't not meant to be everything, just things used often
- The more often used ideas should be near the top of docs
- Incomplete ideas will be put down
- Accuracy of information is essential 
- If two folder concepts overlap, it will be in the lower level closer to hardware/general folder(still pretty vague) e.g Docker in AWS will be in AWS folder
