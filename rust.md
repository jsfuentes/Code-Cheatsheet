# Rust

- Designed to write fast, correct code for large scale maintable systems and embeddable into other languages

- Safety and control
- Safe by design, can't have seg fault, null ptrs, and dangling ptrs, or parallel dat race
- Enums with match, structs, tuples, options, traits that can be implemented or put in generics
- Default immutable and no shared memory, its all opt in with mut and unsafe blocks for everything not allowed
- Rust can talk to C, basically directly with ft calls
