# 2.7 Specific Stuff

```python
from __future__ import print_function
```

 Import the print function from python 3, needs to be near top of code because imported differently and changes things about language

# 3.5 Specific Stuff

## Typing Hinting

This doesn't make python a staticly typed language suddenly, but basically inline comments

```python
def greeting(name: str) -> str:
    return 'Hello ' + name
```

### Type Alias

```python
from typing import List
Vector = List[float]

def scale(scalar: float, vector: Vector) -> Vector:
    return [scalar * num for num in vector]

# typechecks; a list of floats qualifies as a Vector.
new_vector = scale(2.0, [1.0, -4.2, 5.4])
```

## Actually Type Checking

Use pycharm or something with this (atom has a mypy plugin)

OR

`pip install mypy`

`mypy [file]`
