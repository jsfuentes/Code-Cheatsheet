# 2.7 Specific Stuff

```python
from __future__ import absolute_import
from __future__ import division
from __future__ import print_function
```

 Import python 3 functionality(good for migration and changes fundamental python props), needs to be near top of code because imported differently and changes things about language

3/2 = 1

3//2 = 1

# 3.5 Specific Stuff

`3/2` = 1.5

3//2 = 1 

## Iterable Unwrapping

```python
#Python 2
first, rest,last = seq[0], seq[1:-1], seq[-1]
#Python 3
first, *rest, last = seq
```

## Objects

python 3 has different objects or something look it up 

## Print

print is now a ft to be called with () unlike 2

```python
name = 'World'
program = 'Python'
print(f'Hello {name}! This is {program}')
```

## Typing Hinting

This doesn't make python a staticly typed language suddenly, but basically inline comments

```python
def greeting(name: str) -> str:
    return 'Hello ' + name
```

### Type Alias

```python
from typing import List
Vector = List[float]

def scale(scalar: float, vector: Vector) -> Vector:
    return [scalar * num for num in vector]

# typechecks; a list of floats qualifies as a Vector.
new_vector = scale(2.0, [1.0, -4.2, 5.4])
```

## Actually Type Checking

Use pycharm or something with this (atom has a mypy plugin)

OR

`pip install mypy`

`mypy [file]`
