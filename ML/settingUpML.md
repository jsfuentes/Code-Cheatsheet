# Train/Dev/Test Sets

Train with your training data

Dev to see which models perform bst

Test is to actually give you an accuracy rating for your chosen model rather than overfitting dev

With small data go **60/20/20**

With huge data like 1,000,000 can leave 10,000 for dev and 10,000 for test giving a **98/1/1 split**

# Bias Vs. Variance

High Bias == underfitting

High Variance ==overfitting

Can simulteously have high bias and high variance

*Changes based on optimal value, above assumes optimal is 0*

#### High Bias?

- Bigger Netwrok
- Train Longer

**High Variance?**

- More data
- Regularization
